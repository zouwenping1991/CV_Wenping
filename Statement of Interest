Dear Prof. Raccah,

My name is Wenping Zou. I obtained my Ph.D. degree in the summer, 2022 at University of Houston. 
I am writing here to express my sincere interest in open postdoctoral position in your lab. I would love to pursue my postdoctoral research 
as a member of your team. Due to my research experience covers organometallic catalysts design, polymer synthesis, and protein-based sensor 
synthesis, now I still want to continue my research in chemistry, especially interdisciplinary area. The field of photosynthesis is the 
one that unites multiple area including biochemistry, structural biology, mechanics and modeling. As an excellent research institution that
led by creative faculties, the department of chemistry in UT Austin has the most inspiring research environment. I firmly believe that the 
interdisciplinary research experience here will be the most important building block of my career. It will be my honor to join your group. 
  I am a self-motivated, independent research associate with nine yearsâ€™ lab experience. As a hardworking, efficient and detail-oriented 
candidate, I feel my Chemistry and Biology knowledge, protein-based metal sensor research and bioinformatics training experience could be
a major asset to your lab. I would be very happy in setting up a time to discuss my skills and qualifications with you. Please feel free 
to let me know if you have any question and look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely, 
Wenping
